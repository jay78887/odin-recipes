    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>This is my family recipe for Chicken Katsu - Japanese style fried chicken. Can also be used to make Tonkatsu, just use pork cutlets instead of chicken. Serve with white rice and tonkatsu sauce.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>4 skinless, boneless chicken breast halves - pounded to 1/2 inch thickness</li>
        <li> salt and pepper to taste</li>
        <li> 2 tablespoons all-purpose flour</li>
        <li> 1 egg, beaten</li>
        <li> 1 cup panko bread crumbs</li>
        <li> 1 cup oil for frying, or as needed</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol class="steps">
        <li>Season the chicken breasts on both sides with salt and pepper.</li>
        <li>Place the flour, egg and panko crumbs into separate shallow dishes.</li>
        <li>Coat the chicken breasts in flour, shaking off any excess.</li>
        <li>Dip them into the egg, and then press into the panko crumbs until well coated on both sides.</li>
        <li>Heat 1/4 inch of oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat.</li>
        <li>Place chicken in the hot oil, and cook 3 or 4 minutes per side, or until golden brown.</li>
    </ol>
